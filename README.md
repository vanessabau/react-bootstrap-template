# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Create application and install dependencies

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install bootstrap
```

### Add bootstrap to public/indext.html

Add link under <title/>
Add bootstrap script to last line of <body>

```

  </body>
</html>
```

## Run application

`npm start`

Kill Terminal
`ctrl c`

## TO ADD TO GITHUB

From application root:
`git init `

Go to GitHub, create new repository
Name the same as your application
Create new repo, public, no readme

In application copy and paste “…or push an existing repository from the command line” section
All three lines, hit enter
`git add .`
`git commit -m “initial commit”`
`git push origin main`
Now all your react files should be in GitHub

To Deploy
Go to vercel, login
Add new project
Deploy
https://react-bootstrap-template.vercel.app/

To make changes:
Make the code change
`git add .`
`git commit -m “Updated text”`
`git push origin main`

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
